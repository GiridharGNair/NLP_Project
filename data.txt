+ It is different. Not only has George Miller made an effective return to the wasteland of the Mad Max universe with Mad Max: Fury Road, he has surpassed most action films released … well … ever.
+ “Fury’s” pace is delirious, the stunts are incredible — such crashes, such explosions, such a lot of flying bodies — Hardy’s performance is a marvel of subdued conviction and Theron brings an impressive gravity to her work as Furiosa.
+ Mad Max: Fury Road will leave you speechless, which couldn't be more appropriate.
+ It’s all perfectly, wonderfully, fantastically crazy. Amidst all those ingenious, power-packed road warrior sequences, Fury Road contains a surprising amount of depth and character development.
+ This spectacularly great reboot is surprisingly owned not by Hardy, who is fine, but by Charlize Theron.
+ A lunatic vision, as hilarious as it is hellish. And some of the greatest action ever put on screen.
+ There is nothing easy or predictable about what George Miller delivers with Mad Max: Fury Road, a stone-cold action master class, beautiful and brainy and startling in the ways it throws off the current definition of the blockbuster.
- Very disappointing. Did I watch a completely different film than everyone else, or is the general movie going public just easily entertained by wrecks and explosions? 
- I found it to be boring, predictable, and horribly acted.
- I was really disappointed in Mad Max.
+ The movie's a fascinating mess, grand and gaudy, often hilarious.
+ The Wachowskis Craft a Sci-Fi Saga That’s Breathlessly Exciting But Utterly Ridiculous
+ While problematic in sections, Jupiter Ascending delivers on its promise.
+ Jupiter Ascending is kind of goony and more than a little cheesy. But it has some absolutely spectacular highs, including an astonishingly complicated chase over and through Chicago
- The effects are good. The film is well shot. But the performances are awful.
- An empty viewing experience, that promised much and delivered little.
- Aggressively dull and terribly paced.
- With just a few script tweaks, this long, dull and downright bizarre bore-a-thon could have been more aptly named Uranus Numbing.
- The film is deeply cynical about its special effects, which are employed to deter us from the poor script and performances.
+ It's big. It's goofy. It's highly imaginative. It has a little something on its mind. And it's fun.
+ A compelling, rousing and at times strangely moving entertainment.
+ A brutally intelligent political thriller...
+ The explosive V for Vendetta is powered by ideas that are not computer-generated. It's something rare in Teflon Hollywood: a movie that sticks with you.
+ Excellent Movie, Best message and a peak of what may be a visible future for America.
+ Possibly the best film of the year by far, a true achievement in enthralling storytelling and a cast which delivered some of their best individual performances yet. 
+ V for Vendetta is a milestone. Maybe not a big marker, but a milestone nonetheless
- In its ambition to weld a political message onto a comic-book movie it falls rather pitifully between two stools.
- Movie was awful. If you have people you cant stand, suggest this movie to them
- V for Vendetta is a dud - far too long at nearly two and a half hours, with flat, grungy visuals, choppy editing and no sense of urgency.
- V for Very Very Bad Film - As a fan of the comic, my opinion might be considered biased, but the FIVE people I took with me to the cinema had never heard of Alan Moore or V for Vendetta and we all roundly thought that this film was utterly rubbish.
+ Gladiator is a triumph. On the surface, it's a terrific yarn with strong, rounded characters, agonizing suspense and visceral thrills.
+ Gladiator knows its audience wants blood, and it's all too happy to provide it. But as long as you don't come looking for more, it's a satisfying spectacle, in every sense of the word.
+ Glorious, a colossus of rousing action and ferocious fun.
+ It's a stunning Roman triumph.
+ To this day I still think this is the best movie that has ever been made, I love this film.
+ It lives up to the hype. Gladiator has its creaky moments, but it delivers a particular kind of visceral historical spectacle that movie audiences haven't seen in decades.
+ Quite a good movie--a big, fat, rousing, intelligent, daring, retro, many-adjective-requiring entertainment.
- For all its grandeur, Gladiator is a canned experience, a film that flails around awkwardly trying to find a reason to exist, or at least a compelling story to tell.
- The soul of Gladiator is made sluggish by a maddening lack of suspense
- Time for a little gladiatorial gore with your Milk Duds. Gladiator is here, and it's big, glorious and eminently dumb.
+ A must-see — and one of the best films of the year
+ Me and Earl and The Dying Girl is a film that shows that behind the director, there is a new voice with a lot of talent
+ Me and Earl & the Dying Girl is a superb tearjerker that skilfully captures the vulnerability that comes with intimacy and the bittersweet inevitability of life and death.
+ Your new favorite export from the Sundance-industrial complex glows with the heat of festival awards, standing ovations, and distributor bidding wars.
+ It relies on smart writing, clever ideas, terrific cinematography and rich, complex characters who are inhabited by three superb young actors, as well as a cast of crafty veterans in the supporting roles.
+ His film is at once buzzy, fun and confronting.
+ This movie is a highly original masterpiece
- This largely casual coming of age story doesn't adequately prepare the way for big drama and emotion, which consequently comes off falsely.
- Undone by a wildly inconsistent tone, narrative devices that rotate between incongruous cuteness and bald-faced lying, and a protagonist who's just a horrendous, despicable character.
- A pandering, self-flattering mess, featuring unearned catharsis, lazy clichés and characters presented in broad, sometimes-offensive stereotypes.
+ With Inglourious Basterds, Quentin Tarantino has made his best movie since "Pulp Fiction."
+ It's not enough to say that Inglourious Basterds is Quentin Tarantino's best movie. It's the first movie of his artistic maturity, the film his talent has been promising for more than 15 years.
+ This is one in a long line of classics by Tarrantino. It is a cinematic masterpiece.
+ A smart, sophisticated and perplexing blend of wisdom and attitude that takes bold risks, sneers at convention and then still has enough audacity to rewrite the history books for one last daring climax.
+ The intricate plot offers a wealth of opportunities for scene-stopping showpieces of all kinds, from epic spectacle to intimate character work.
+ The dialogue is fabulous.
- A failure so complete that it is infuriating as opposed to merely disappointing
- Tarantino is loosing his touch. Very dull, so very dull.
- Why is Basterds such a colossal disappointment? It's mostly because Tarantino indulges all of his worst impulses as a filmmaker and ignores what he does best
- Clocking in at 2 hours and 32 minutes, it is unforgivably leisurely, almost glacial, a film that loses its way in the thickets of alternative history and manages to be violent without the start-to-finish energy that violence on screen usually guarantees.
+ It's a high-wire act without a net, and Benigni pulls it off with astounding grace and sensitivity.
+ Benigni does with the Nazi setting what Chaplin didn't dare in The Great Dictator--he lets the liberating nonsense triumph.
+ Benigni's point, made with tender sensitivity, is that a child's innocence is worth protecting.
+ Yes, there are heaps of charm and poignancy in this trifle, but it's a trifle nonetheless -- light-and-bright, for sure, but also slight-and-trite.
+ Benigni, with great help from young Cantarini, has crafted a work of such complexity that you may find both your brain and your heart simply overloaded
+ The concept is not so much nihilistic as it is realistic, and the fact that Benigni has made such fine distinctions so powerfully clear is amazing and moving.
+ This was the sweetest, funniest and most human story that could have ever come out of the Holocaust
- Benigni's movie made me want to throw up
- Painfully horrible movie with an inappropriate story, terrbile bad humour an a hyper-irritating lead actor. 
- The picture doesn't work, at least not to the extent it was intended to.
+ Underrated comic excellence from Sacha Baron Cohen with plenty of sharp satire lacing the broader gross-out gags.
+ The film's writers understand that satire is infinitely more powerful when it's accessible
+ It doesn't have much to say about the character Cohen portrays or about how the world perceives that stereotype, which results in a paper thin but generally amusing little farce
- Consistently offensive, and not in a way that should automatically be dismissed as 'edgy' or 'provocative'.
- A few laughs here and there at the expense of offensive stereotypes, The Dictator mostly repeats jokes we've seen in other, better Sacha Baron Cohen films
- Even amid the hit-and-miss broadsides and laugh-free longueurs that comprise most of “The Dictator,” Cohen’s acute hypocrisy-detector keeps on ticking, if barely.
- I went into this movie expecting light entertainment, and got even less. A few giggles here and there, but for the most part, The Dictator was agonizing to watch.
- I saw this in the theater today, well the 30 opening minutes at least. they were bad enough for me to walk out.
- Disappointment soon led to anger. The laughs were few and cheap.
- All in all a very disappointing movie, too much hype with the trailer....
+ The superbly crafted suspense thriller…slams you like a sudden blast of bone-chilling, pulse-pounding terror.
+ A mesmerizing thriller that will grip audiences from first scene to last.
+ A fantastic, haunting experience. You won't be scared in the traditional horror movie sense, but you will be terrified in the psychological horror sense.
+ It is definitely one of the best films in the 90s and one of the rare films that well deserved its oscars.
+ A creepy, at times horrific movie with incredible performances.
+ Chilling and creepy, and there's no denying that the most celebrated aspect of the film -- the Clarice/Hannibal connection -- could not have been accomplished with greater skill.
+ As Lecter, Anthony Hopkins gives an astounding performance -- eery, menacing, creepy, believable.
+ An exceptionally good film, perhaps this fine director's best, in which the horror genre is elevated into the kind of cinema that can at least be argued about as a treatise for its unsettling times.
+ Director Jonathan Demme keeps the film intense and haunting, and Jodie Foster compelling to watch.
- Anthony Hopkins gives the most overrated performance of all time. He way overplayed it
+ Kramer vs. Kramer is, essentially, a television movie that was raised into the feature category by the excellence of the execution.
+ Kramer vs. Kramer is one of the most sensitive and least judgmental film about relationships ever made in the United States.... One of the important films
+ Kramer vs. Kramer is a perceptive, touching, intelligent film about one of the raw sores of contemporary America, the dissolution of the family unit.
+ Even when its emotions run a bit out of control, Kramer vs. Kramer is a strong and positive film. Its performances are first-rate, from Hoffman and streep down to Howard Duff
+ Kramer vs. Kramer is greatly enriched by its exceptional cast. 
+ It remains one of the most compelling films of the decade
+ What a great movie is this! A classic...! 
- Another in a long list of those overrated Oscar winners for Best Picture.
- This looks, in retrospect, like nothing much more than a glossy soap passed off as serious drama
+ This excellent struggle of a dad to keep his son by his side is a pure classic, with Hoffman at his best
+ This Steven Spielberg thriller remains one of his best films and one of the best summer blockbusters of all time.  
+ I loved every fascinating, suspenseful, frightening, skilfully calibrated minute of it.
+ Jurassic Park is a masterpiece!
+ Steven Spielberg's summer adventure is still one of the ultimate movie roller coaster rides.
+ Still proves as thrilling as ever.
+ The film is a classic
+ One great monster movie
+ Colossal entertainment -- the eye-popping, mind-bending, kick-out-the-jams thrill ride of summer and probably the year.
- The most overrated movie of all time.
- Not worth the time.
+ Remarkably creative film is inventive both in story and visual style.
+ Citizen Kane, written, produced, directed and played by Orson Welles, is probably the most exciting film that has come out of Hollywood 
+ It can be classified as, in a number of aspects, one of the most arresting pictures ever produced.
+ One of the best films out there, and certainly a high point in early cinema. The love for Citizen Kane is deserved.
+ There can hardly be anything left to say about Citizen Kane, now revived on the big screen, other than to comment on sublime moments.
+ A ground-breaking masterpiece. It contains so many examples of cinematic brilliance that it's a shock it won only one Oscar
+ Truly one of the greatest films ever.
+ Citizen Kane is the biggest cinematic landmark since pictures first started moving.
+ It remains a gloriously entertaining classic.
+ The fresh classic masterpiece
+ In this brilliantly sustained climax, Coppola unveils a vision of corruption that embraces the entire world
+ The Godfather Part III matches its predecessors in narrative intensity, epic scope, socio-political analysis, physical beauty and deep feeling for its characters and milieu
+ Most film sequels are strictly optional. The Godfather Part III is inevitable, and as such it's irresistible.
+ Very few have stepped up to bat to defend The Godfather Part III (1990), which I consider a masterpiece and the equal of Parts I and II
+ The Godfather Part III is a good movie, with moments of rare power, but it is not a great one
+ Get a grip you lot - it's only a movie. And it's a really good movie too.
+ Yeah - definitely flawed - but still really great.
- Abysmal film. Unbelievable work from Scorcese. The film has lost all its glamour character and depth.
- The Godfather Part III isn't just a disappointment, it's a failure of heartbreaking proportions... It makes you wish it had never been made.
- More than merely another bad movie, it's the most depressing development yet in Coppola's career. 
+ Excellent but mature film about finding a connection.
+ Wonderfully warm and witty
+ An excellent top notch gem with beautiful direction courtesy of Sofia Coppola...
+ What's astonishing about Sofia Coppola's enthralling new movie is the precision, maturity, and originality with which the confident young writer-director communicates so clearly in a cinematic language all her own.
+ A lovely, quietly thrilling thing
+ Pure perfection. Moving and touching everytime. The ending brings tears every watch.
+ Filled by excellent performances by Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson, great writing, great directing, loveable characters, realistic dialogue and the total opposite of your typical Hollywood movie clichés.
+ Lost in Translation is one of the most engaging films I have ever seen 
- The worst film ever made. Boring, pointless, meandering garbage that feels as though it was conceived by an infant
- The worst film ever made. Boring, pointless, meandering garbage that feels as though it was conceived by an infant
+ A raucous and entertaining action horror entry with great performances, and a vicious villain.
+ It revels in its own retro-ness, and it's a hell of a lot of fun
+ A great Indiana Jones movie without Indiana Jones.
+ like that big, dumb, lovable dog you had as a kid, you can't help liking it.
+ The combination of makeup and computer graphics make Imhotep an awesome enemy!
+ Brainless fun
- A weightless, instantly forgettable picture
- One more overblown exercise in big budget lameness
- One of the more confused productions in recent cinematic history
- A failure in more ways than a mortal would have time to explain
+ A lot of fun with excellent direction
+ An enjoyable action flick
+ Better than anyone had any right to expect
+ The key to what makes "I, Robot" work is a well thought out script
+ It's all mechanically done, but at least I Robot manages to be entertaining
+ better than I ever expected it to be on most levels.
- A dull, derivative [film] with no new ideas and a main character who, while clearly simple-minded, is somehow the smartest guy in the story
- An uninspired, recycled action thriller.
- I, Robot is a disappointment not because of what it is, but because of what it could have been.
- I, Robot fails to do much of anything other than take our money and repay us with some moments of CGI-induced spectacle and a handful of rehashed ideas.
+ There's something to be said for a formula picture done almost to perfection. In 2012, Emmerich gives you everything you expect, but gives it to you bigger
+ 2012 isn't a bad movie that, out of sheer boredom, you might snicker at once or twice; it's a two-and-a-half hour laugh riot that plays on our expectations of the genre by anticipating and exceeding them.
+ I was very pleasantly surprised! Maybe these harsh reviewers were expecting Shakespeare. This is a fun, entertaining movie that really delivers.
+ It's a good movie. The special effects were just unreal. 
+ The end of the world movie to end 'em all, it turns out to be a sort of cross between the sci-fi camptacular When Worlds Collide and every previous Emmerich movie. Guilty pleasures galore
- Over the top scenes of destruction aside 2012 is generally unimaginative in every way, from conception to execution. It's not particularly bad, but never has the end of the world seemed so quaint.
- At points, 2012 was tedious enough to make us feel like we were in the theater until 2012
- A headache inducing mess of apocalyptic proportions, 2012 is a woeful greatest hits package of disaster film clichés, mixed with shallow social commentary.
- I can't claim to have seen every terrible film in cinematic history, but in my fairly extensive watchography, 2012 is certainly in the top 5 worst ever
- Even though the extras [on the DVD] are chock-a-block, they are still for a bad movie.
+ Miyazaki's visually brilliant, thematically rich fable isn't just an ambitious cartoon; it's an epic, hand-drawn in pen and ink.
+ Done mostly in the style of hand-painted classic animation, with occasional digital assists, "Princess Mononoke is indeed a thing of beauty and imagination.
+ This handsome, beautifully designed Japanese animated film has the size -- though not the clarity -- of a great Japanese film epic
+ Beautifully constructed and painstakingly written, this is about as close to a perfect animated epic as you're likely to get.
+ It's a masterpiece, and a perfect introduction for potential Miyazaki fans.
+ This imaginative and intriguing Anime deserves all the plaudits heaped upon it.
+ Miyazaki's world is stunning for its richness and imagination.
+ Hayao Miyazaki is a great animator, and his Princess Mononoke is a great film.
- What the hell is wrong with the world. This was possibly the worst movie I've ever seen
- I hated this movie, it was so hard to get through
+ A richly inventive and enchanting delight.
+ A strange delight awash in visual splendor, understated humor and clever body-and-soul transmogrifications among its bonny band of weirdos.
+ What you get, above all, is some enchanting flashes of classic Miyazaki and the nagging sense that something essential is missing
+ Miyazaki's vision is an extraordinary one, and Howl's Moving Castle confirms his fascination for transformations, for dangerous journeys and strange adventures.
The film, as expected, is a feast for the eyes.
+ A very good fantasy epic about life, war, and a young learning to live through old age.
+ What a moveable feast of delights
- There is little of the magic and Japanese flavour of such Miyazaki masterpieces as Spirited Away
- This movie stinks!
- A big disappointment. It was beautiful, of course, as all Miyazaki movies are, but the story Made No Sense At All
+ Bridge of Spies is an inspiring drama about a man, like any of us, who struggled to do the right thing. 
+ Bridge of Spies is a quality film featuring loads of commendable work
+ Simply the best film Spielberg has made in decades.
+ A fascinating story where the interactions between smart and unpredictable characters is the main focus.
+ With Hanks on superb form, Spielberg delivering a visually stunning and surprisingly feel-good thriller, Bridge of Spies absolutely satisfies
+ A fascinating story where the interactions between smart and unpredictable characters is the main focus.
+ As gripping and as smart a piece of entertainment as you'll find this year
- highly-polished garbage from almost the beginning, with no relief from its elderly ministrations all the way through to the end.
- This was one of the most boring films I have ever seen. 
- How Steven Spielberg went from the king of summer thrills to the most boring director in Hollywood is a problem that's perplexed me since I pried my eyes open through Lincoln.
+ Isao Takahata's masterpiece is one of the most profound anti-war statements ever brought to cinema
+ There are magical moments of natural beauty and childish delight, too - which only make the tragedy even more harrowing.
+ The wonderful lasting mark of a true artist
+ Incredibly moving. The ultimate tear-jerker.
+ Very simply the gentlest and most touching war-related film I've ever seen.
+ Ranks among the greatest of anime.
+ An emotional experience so powerful that it forces a rethinking of animation.
+ haunting...devastating
+ Ultimately, the picture's respect for Seito and Setsuko's ability to fend for themselves results in a far more powerful piece of cinema than if they'd been portrayed as the typical scared kid.
- Wasn't as engaging as people say... dejected
+ This time out, writer and director Mark Steven Johnson has bounced back with a movie so full of camp spirit it should come with tents and a marshmallow roast.
+ Really cool action with Nicolas Cage and stunning FX
+ I really don't understand the low ratings. Ghost Rider was quite enjoyable
+ An oddly beguiling mixture of horror movie, biker flick, pulp Faust legend, redemption melodrama and western, featuring quite astonishing special effects.
- The worst adaptation of a Marvel Comics hero yet
- Shamelessly cribs from the "Spawn" film.
- When this movie first came out, I was really excited. I was really hoping for a scary and exciting superhero movie. But after watching what was so suppose to be excellent, this was pure crap
- Ghost Rider fails for the same reason every bad movie does: poor storytelling and bad acting.
- An abysmal excuse of a film featuring Nicolas Cage's worst performance yet and only marginally improving on the Spawn formula.
- Anyone who knows the character from the comics will be disappointed.
+ This sometimes magnificent, decidedly strange film is a portrait of a terrible, rapacious man
+ It takes a talented person to make a great film, but it takes an even more talented one to know when to say enough is enough
+ One helluva film; the best in Anderson's young career.
+ I just sat there in awe the entire two hours and thirty minutes of the film, just completely stunned as to what I was seeing.
+ There Will Be Blood is ferocious, and it will be championed and attacked with an equal ferocity. When the dust settles, we may look back on it as some kind of obsessed classic.
+ With There Will Be Blood, Paul Thomas Anderson has taken a stab at making The Great American Movie -- and I daresay he’s made one of them.
+ This is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time
+ Daniel Day-Lewis and Paul Thomas Anderson have created one of the greatest movies of this time and perhaps of all time
- I hate the way the film forces us into its epic structure and purposefully fractured narrative as if the audience is a puppy having its little nose shoved in a puddle of its own making.
- i hated this movie. and years after watching it, i still hate it.
+ A masterpiece
+ Kubrick has made a movie that will have to be reckoned with on the highest level
+ One of the best scary movies ever made, one of the best scary movies even imaginable.
+ A horror classic. An unforgettable performance by Jack Nicholson as the tortured soul of Jack Torrance. 
+ My favorite film of Kubrick's. You feel like you're becoming as mad as Johnny while watching
+ A great movie with thrilling elements
+ Meticulously detailed and never less than fascinating, The Shining may be the first movie that ever made its audience jump with a title that simply says "Tuesday."
- Possibly the dumbest movie I've seen. Not scary at all. 
- One of Kubrick's most severely overcooked, overdetermined projects; Duvall fascinates, but the rest bores and wearies.
- I can't recall a more elaborately ineffective scare movie.
+ Saving Private Ryan is a masterpiece. It cements Steven Spielberg's reputation as one of the seminal filmmakers of the era.
+ An overwhelming experience.
+ Steven Spielberg's new film begins as a monumental epic; then it diminishes; and, by its finish, is baffling. 
+ I think this movie is just incredible, Mr Spielberg and Mr Hanks are just masters fo the film business.
+ A very high quality, which blends extreme action, with a underlying sadness for the disaster that was world war 2.
+ Saving Private Ryan is the best war movie ever made and one of the best in general in the movie history. 
+ No Hollywood film within recent memory has achieved such richness and originality of texture, such a compelling amalgam of passionate human drama and awesome technique.
- The result, I am sorry to say, is that Saving Private Ryan seems almost banal in its achievement, a film that sacrifices humanity for technical wizardry
- I found it tediously manipulative despite its Herculean energy.
- A bitter, bloody masterpiece with adrenalized emotions and hyper-realized images.
