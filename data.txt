+ It is different. Not only has George Miller made an effective return to the wasteland of the Mad Max universe with Mad Max: Fury Road, he has surpassed most action films released … well … ever.
+ “Fury’s” pace is delirious, the stunts are incredible — such crashes, such explosions, such a lot of flying bodies — Hardy’s performance is a marvel of subdued conviction and Theron brings an impressive gravity to her work as Furiosa.
+ Mad Max: Fury Road will leave you speechless, which couldn't be more appropriate.
+ It’s all perfectly, wonderfully, fantastically crazy. Amidst all those ingenious, power-packed road warrior sequences, Fury Road contains a surprising amount of depth and character development.
+ This spectacularly great reboot is surprisingly owned not by Hardy, who is fine, but by Charlize Theron.
+ A lunatic vision, as hilarious as it is hellish. And some of the greatest action ever put on screen.
+ There is nothing easy or predictable about what George Miller delivers with Mad Max: Fury Road, a stone-cold action master class, beautiful and brainy and startling in the ways it throws off the current definition of the blockbuster.
- Very disappointing. Did I watch a completely different film than everyone else, or is the general movie going public just easily entertained by wrecks and explosions? 
- I found it to be boring, predictable, and horribly acted.
- I was really disappointed in Mad Max.
+ The movie's a fascinating mess, grand and gaudy, often hilarious.
+ The Wachowskis Craft a Sci-Fi Saga That’s Breathlessly Exciting But Utterly Ridiculous
+ While problematic in sections, Jupiter Ascending delivers on its promise.
+ Jupiter Ascending is kind of goony and more than a little cheesy. But it has some absolutely spectacular highs, including an astonishingly complicated chase over and through Chicago
- The effects are good. The film is well shot. But the performances are awful.
- An empty viewing experience, that promised much and delivered little.
- Aggressively dull and terribly paced.
- With just a few script tweaks, this long, dull and downright bizarre bore-a-thon could have been more aptly named Uranus Numbing.
- The film is deeply cynical about its special effects, which are employed to deter us from the poor script and performances.
+ It's big. It's goofy. It's highly imaginative. It has a little something on its mind. And it's fun.
+ A compelling, rousing and at times strangely moving entertainment.
+ A brutally intelligent political thriller...
+ The explosive V for Vendetta is powered by ideas that are not computer-generated. It's something rare in Teflon Hollywood: a movie that sticks with you.
+ Excellent Movie, Best message and a peak of what may be a visible future for America.
+ Possibly the best film of the year by far, a true achievement in enthralling storytelling and a cast which delivered some of their best individual performances yet. 
+ V for Vendetta is a milestone. Maybe not a big marker, but a milestone nonetheless
- In its ambition to weld a political message onto a comic-book movie it falls rather pitifully between two stools.
- Movie was awful. If you have people you cant stand, suggest this movie to them
- V for Vendetta is a dud - far too long at nearly two and a half hours, with flat, grungy visuals, choppy editing and no sense of urgency.
- V for Very Very Bad Film - As a fan of the comic, my opinion might be considered biased, but the FIVE people I took with me to the cinema had never heard of Alan Moore or V for Vendetta and we all roundly thought that this film was utterly rubbish.
+ Gladiator is a triumph. On the surface, it's a terrific yarn with strong, rounded characters, agonizing suspense and visceral thrills.
+ Gladiator knows its audience wants blood, and it's all too happy to provide it. But as long as you don't come looking for more, it's a satisfying spectacle, in every sense of the word.
+ Glorious, a colossus of rousing action and ferocious fun.
+ It's a stunning Roman triumph.
+ To this day I still think this is the best movie that has ever been made, I love this film.
+ It lives up to the hype. Gladiator has its creaky moments, but it delivers a particular kind of visceral historical spectacle that movie audiences haven't seen in decades.
+ Quite a good movie--a big, fat, rousing, intelligent, daring, retro, many-adjective-requiring entertainment.
- For all its grandeur, Gladiator is a canned experience, a film that flails around awkwardly trying to find a reason to exist, or at least a compelling story to tell.
- The soul of Gladiator is made sluggish by a maddening lack of suspense
- Time for a little gladiatorial gore with your Milk Duds. Gladiator is here, and it's big, glorious and eminently dumb.
+ A must-see — and one of the best films of the year
+ Me and Earl and The Dying Girl is a film that shows that behind the director, there is a new voice with a lot of talent
+ Me and Earl & the Dying Girl is a superb tearjerker that skilfully captures the vulnerability that comes with intimacy and the bittersweet inevitability of life and death.
+ Your new favorite export from the Sundance-industrial complex glows with the heat of festival awards, standing ovations, and distributor bidding wars.
+ It relies on smart writing, clever ideas, terrific cinematography and rich, complex characters who are inhabited by three superb young actors, as well as a cast of crafty veterans in the supporting roles.
+ His film is at once buzzy, fun and confronting.
+ This movie is a highly original masterpiece
- This largely casual coming of age story doesn't adequately prepare the way for big drama and emotion, which consequently comes off falsely.
- Undone by a wildly inconsistent tone, narrative devices that rotate between incongruous cuteness and bald-faced lying, and a protagonist who's just a horrendous, despicable character.
- A pandering, self-flattering mess, featuring unearned catharsis, lazy clichés and characters presented in broad, sometimes-offensive stereotypes.
+ With Inglourious Basterds, Quentin Tarantino has made his best movie since "Pulp Fiction."
+ It's not enough to say that Inglourious Basterds is Quentin Tarantino's best movie. It's the first movie of his artistic maturity, the film his talent has been promising for more than 15 years.
+ This is one in a long line of classics by Tarrantino. It is a cinematic masterpiece.
+ A smart, sophisticated and perplexing blend of wisdom and attitude that takes bold risks, sneers at convention and then still has enough audacity to rewrite the history books for one last daring climax.
+ The intricate plot offers a wealth of opportunities for scene-stopping showpieces of all kinds, from epic spectacle to intimate character work.
+ The dialogue is fabulous.
- A failure so complete that it is infuriating as opposed to merely disappointing
- Tarantino is loosing his touch. Very dull, so very dull.
- Why is Basterds such a colossal disappointment? It's mostly because Tarantino indulges all of his worst impulses as a filmmaker and ignores what he does best
- Clocking in at 2 hours and 32 minutes, it is unforgivably leisurely, almost glacial, a film that loses its way in the thickets of alternative history and manages to be violent without the start-to-finish energy that violence on screen usually guarantees.
+ It's a high-wire act without a net, and Benigni pulls it off with astounding grace and sensitivity.
+ Benigni does with the Nazi setting what Chaplin didn't dare in The Great Dictator--he lets the liberating nonsense triumph.
+ Benigni's point, made with tender sensitivity, is that a child's innocence is worth protecting.
+ Yes, there are heaps of charm and poignancy in this trifle, but it's a trifle nonetheless -- light-and-bright, for sure, but also slight-and-trite.
+ Benigni, with great help from young Cantarini, has crafted a work of such complexity that you may find both your brain and your heart simply overloaded
+ The concept is not so much nihilistic as it is realistic, and the fact that Benigni has made such fine distinctions so powerfully clear is amazing and moving.
+ This was the sweetest, funniest and most human story that could have ever come out of the Holocaust
- Benigni's movie made me want to throw up
- Painfully horrible movie with an inappropriate story, terrbile bad humour an a hyper-irritating lead actor. 
- The picture doesn't work, at least not to the extent it was intended to.
+ Underrated comic excellence from Sacha Baron Cohen with plenty of sharp satire lacing the broader gross-out gags.
+ The film's writers understand that satire is infinitely more powerful when it's accessible
+ It doesn't have much to say about the character Cohen portrays or about how the world perceives that stereotype, which results in a paper thin but generally amusing little farce
- Consistently offensive, and not in a way that should automatically be dismissed as 'edgy' or 'provocative'.
- A few laughs here and there at the expense of offensive stereotypes, The Dictator mostly repeats jokes we've seen in other, better Sacha Baron Cohen films
- Even amid the hit-and-miss broadsides and laugh-free longueurs that comprise most of “The Dictator,” Cohen’s acute hypocrisy-detector keeps on ticking, if barely.
- I went into this movie expecting light entertainment, and got even less. A few giggles here and there, but for the most part, The Dictator was agonizing to watch.
- I saw this in the theater today, well the 30 opening minutes at least. they were bad enough for me to walk out.
- Disappointment soon led to anger. The laughs were few and cheap.
- All in all a very disappointing movie, too much hype with the trailer....
+ The superbly crafted suspense thriller…slams you like a sudden blast of bone-chilling, pulse-pounding terror.
+ A mesmerizing thriller that will grip audiences from first scene to last.
+ A fantastic, haunting experience. You won't be scared in the traditional horror movie sense, but you will be terrified in the psychological horror sense.
+ It is definitely one of the best films in the 90s and one of the rare films that well deserved its oscars.
+ A creepy, at times horrific movie with incredible performances.
+ Chilling and creepy, and there's no denying that the most celebrated aspect of the film -- the Clarice/Hannibal connection -- could not have been accomplished with greater skill.
+ As Lecter, Anthony Hopkins gives an astounding performance -- eery, menacing, creepy, believable.
+ An exceptionally good film, perhaps this fine director's best, in which the horror genre is elevated into the kind of cinema that can at least be argued about as a treatise for its unsettling times.
+ Director Jonathan Demme keeps the film intense and haunting, and Jodie Foster compelling to watch.
- Anthony Hopkins gives the most overrated performance of all time. He way overplayed it
+ Kramer vs. Kramer is, essentially, a television movie that was raised into the feature category by the excellence of the execution.
+ Kramer vs. Kramer is one of the most sensitive and least judgmental film about relationships ever made in the United States.... One of the important films
+ Kramer vs. Kramer is a perceptive, touching, intelligent film about one of the raw sores of contemporary America, the dissolution of the family unit.
+ Even when its emotions run a bit out of control, Kramer vs. Kramer is a strong and positive film. Its performances are first-rate, from Hoffman and streep down to Howard Duff
+ Kramer vs. Kramer is greatly enriched by its exceptional cast. 
+ It remains one of the most compelling films of the decade
+ What a great movie is this! A classic...! 
- Another in a long list of those overrated Oscar winners for Best Picture.
- This looks, in retrospect, like nothing much more than a glossy soap passed off as serious drama
+ This excellent struggle of a dad to keep his son by his side is a pure classic, with Hoffman at his best
+ This Steven Spielberg thriller remains one of his best films and one of the best summer blockbusters of all time.  
+ I loved every fascinating, suspenseful, frightening, skilfully calibrated minute of it.
+ Jurassic Park is a masterpiece!
+ Steven Spielberg's summer adventure is still one of the ultimate movie roller coaster rides.
+ Still proves as thrilling as ever.
+ The film is a classic
+ One great monster movie
+ Colossal entertainment -- the eye-popping, mind-bending, kick-out-the-jams thrill ride of summer and probably the year.
- The most overrated movie of all time.
- Not worth the time.
+ Remarkably creative film is inventive both in story and visual style.
+ Citizen Kane, written, produced, directed and played by Orson Welles, is probably the most exciting film that has come out of Hollywood 
+ It can be classified as, in a number of aspects, one of the most arresting pictures ever produced.
+ One of the best films out there, and certainly a high point in early cinema. The love for Citizen Kane is deserved.
+ There can hardly be anything left to say about Citizen Kane, now revived on the big screen, other than to comment on sublime moments.
+ A ground-breaking masterpiece. It contains so many examples of cinematic brilliance that it's a shock it won only one Oscar
+ Truly one of the greatest films ever.
+ Citizen Kane is the biggest cinematic landmark since pictures first started moving.
+ It remains a gloriously entertaining classic.
+ The fresh classic masterpiece
+ In this brilliantly sustained climax, Coppola unveils a vision of corruption that embraces the entire world
+ The Godfather Part III matches its predecessors in narrative intensity, epic scope, socio-political analysis, physical beauty and deep feeling for its characters and milieu
+ Most film sequels are strictly optional. The Godfather Part III is inevitable, and as such it's irresistible.
+ Very few have stepped up to bat to defend The Godfather Part III (1990), which I consider a masterpiece and the equal of Parts I and II
+ The Godfather Part III is a good movie, with moments of rare power, but it is not a great one
+ Get a grip you lot - it's only a movie. And it's a really good movie too.
+ Yeah - definitely flawed - but still really great.
- Abysmal film. Unbelievable work from Scorcese. The film has lost all its glamour character and depth.
- The Godfather Part III isn't just a disappointment, it's a failure of heartbreaking proportions... It makes you wish it had never been made.
- More than merely another bad movie, it's the most depressing development yet in Coppola's career. 
+ Excellent but mature film about finding a connection.
+ Wonderfully warm and witty
+ An excellent top notch gem with beautiful direction courtesy of Sofia Coppola...
+ What's astonishing about Sofia Coppola's enthralling new movie is the precision, maturity, and originality with which the confident young writer-director communicates so clearly in a cinematic language all her own.
+ A lovely, quietly thrilling thing
+ Pure perfection. Moving and touching everytime. The ending brings tears every watch.
+ Filled by excellent performances by Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson, great writing, great directing, loveable characters, realistic dialogue and the total opposite of your typical Hollywood movie clichés.
+ Lost in Translation is one of the most engaging films I have ever seen 
- The worst film ever made. Boring, pointless, meandering garbage that feels as though it was conceived by an infant
- The worst film ever made. Boring, pointless, meandering garbage that feels as though it was conceived by an infant
+ A raucous and entertaining action horror entry with great performances, and a vicious villain.
+ It revels in its own retro-ness, and it's a hell of a lot of fun
+ A great Indiana Jones movie without Indiana Jones.
+ like that big, dumb, lovable dog you had as a kid, you can't help liking it.
+ The combination of makeup and computer graphics make Imhotep an awesome enemy!
+ Brainless fun
- A weightless, instantly forgettable picture
- One more overblown exercise in big budget lameness
- One of the more confused productions in recent cinematic history
- A failure in more ways than a mortal would have time to explain
+ A lot of fun with excellent direction
+ An enjoyable action flick
+ Better than anyone had any right to expect
+ The key to what makes "I, Robot" work is a well thought out script
+ It's all mechanically done, but at least I Robot manages to be entertaining
+ better than I ever expected it to be on most levels.
- A dull, derivative [film] with no new ideas and a main character who, while clearly simple-minded, is somehow the smartest guy in the story
- An uninspired, recycled action thriller.
- I, Robot is a disappointment not because of what it is, but because of what it could have been.
- I, Robot fails to do much of anything other than take our money and repay us with some moments of CGI-induced spectacle and a handful of rehashed ideas.
+ There's something to be said for a formula picture done almost to perfection. In 2012, Emmerich gives you everything you expect, but gives it to you bigger
+ 2012 isn't a bad movie that, out of sheer boredom, you might snicker at once or twice; it's a two-and-a-half hour laugh riot that plays on our expectations of the genre by anticipating and exceeding them.
+ I was very pleasantly surprised! Maybe these harsh reviewers were expecting Shakespeare. This is a fun, entertaining movie that really delivers.
+ It's a good movie. The special effects were just unreal. 
+ The end of the world movie to end 'em all, it turns out to be a sort of cross between the sci-fi camptacular When Worlds Collide and every previous Emmerich movie. Guilty pleasures galore
- Over the top scenes of destruction aside 2012 is generally unimaginative in every way, from conception to execution. It's not particularly bad, but never has the end of the world seemed so quaint.
- At points, 2012 was tedious enough to make us feel like we were in the theater until 2012
- A headache inducing mess of apocalyptic proportions, 2012 is a woeful greatest hits package of disaster film clichés, mixed with shallow social commentary.
- I can't claim to have seen every terrible film in cinematic history, but in my fairly extensive watchography, 2012 is certainly in the top 5 worst ever
- Even though the extras [on the DVD] are chock-a-block, they are still for a bad movie.
+ Miyazaki's visually brilliant, thematically rich fable isn't just an ambitious cartoon; it's an epic, hand-drawn in pen and ink.
+ Done mostly in the style of hand-painted classic animation, with occasional digital assists, "Princess Mononoke is indeed a thing of beauty and imagination.
+ This handsome, beautifully designed Japanese animated film has the size -- though not the clarity -- of a great Japanese film epic
+ Beautifully constructed and painstakingly written, this is about as close to a perfect animated epic as you're likely to get.
+ It's a masterpiece, and a perfect introduction for potential Miyazaki fans.
+ This imaginative and intriguing Anime deserves all the plaudits heaped upon it.
+ Miyazaki's world is stunning for its richness and imagination.
+ Hayao Miyazaki is a great animator, and his Princess Mononoke is a great film.
- What the hell is wrong with the world. This was possibly the worst movie I've ever seen
- I hated this movie, it was so hard to get through
+ A richly inventive and enchanting delight.
+ A strange delight awash in visual splendor, understated humor and clever body-and-soul transmogrifications among its bonny band of weirdos.
+ What you get, above all, is some enchanting flashes of classic Miyazaki and the nagging sense that something essential is missing
+ Miyazaki's vision is an extraordinary one, and Howl's Moving Castle confirms his fascination for transformations, for dangerous journeys and strange adventures.
The film, as expected, is a feast for the eyes.
+ A very good fantasy epic about life, war, and a young learning to live through old age.
+ What a moveable feast of delights
- There is little of the magic and Japanese flavour of such Miyazaki masterpieces as Spirited Away
- This movie stinks!
- A big disappointment. It was beautiful, of course, as all Miyazaki movies are, but the story Made No Sense At All
+ Bridge of Spies is an inspiring drama about a man, like any of us, who struggled to do the right thing. 
+ Bridge of Spies is a quality film featuring loads of commendable work
+ Simply the best film Spielberg has made in decades.
+ A fascinating story where the interactions between smart and unpredictable characters is the main focus.
+ With Hanks on superb form, Spielberg delivering a visually stunning and surprisingly feel-good thriller, Bridge of Spies absolutely satisfies
+ A fascinating story where the interactions between smart and unpredictable characters is the main focus.
+ As gripping and as smart a piece of entertainment as you'll find this year
- highly-polished garbage from almost the beginning, with no relief from its elderly ministrations all the way through to the end.
- This was one of the most boring films I have ever seen. 
- How Steven Spielberg went from the king of summer thrills to the most boring director in Hollywood is a problem that's perplexed me since I pried my eyes open through Lincoln.
+ Isao Takahata's masterpiece is one of the most profound anti-war statements ever brought to cinema
+ There are magical moments of natural beauty and childish delight, too - which only make the tragedy even more harrowing.
+ The wonderful lasting mark of a true artist
+ Incredibly moving. The ultimate tear-jerker.
+ Very simply the gentlest and most touching war-related film I've ever seen.
+ Ranks among the greatest of anime.
+ An emotional experience so powerful that it forces a rethinking of animation.
+ haunting...devastating
+ Ultimately, the picture's respect for Seito and Setsuko's ability to fend for themselves results in a far more powerful piece of cinema than if they'd been portrayed as the typical scared kid.
- Wasn't as engaging as people say... dejected
+ This time out, writer and director Mark Steven Johnson has bounced back with a movie so full of camp spirit it should come with tents and a marshmallow roast.
+ Really cool action with Nicolas Cage and stunning FX
+ I really don't understand the low ratings. Ghost Rider was quite enjoyable
+ An oddly beguiling mixture of horror movie, biker flick, pulp Faust legend, redemption melodrama and western, featuring quite astonishing special effects.
- The worst adaptation of a Marvel Comics hero yet
- Shamelessly cribs from the "Spawn" film.
- When this movie first came out, I was really excited. I was really hoping for a scary and exciting superhero movie. But after watching what was so suppose to be excellent, this was pure crap
- Ghost Rider fails for the same reason every bad movie does: poor storytelling and bad acting.
- An abysmal excuse of a film featuring Nicolas Cage's worst performance yet and only marginally improving on the Spawn formula.
- Anyone who knows the character from the comics will be disappointed.
+ This sometimes magnificent, decidedly strange film is a portrait of a terrible, rapacious man
+ It takes a talented person to make a great film, but it takes an even more talented one to know when to say enough is enough
+ One helluva film; the best in Anderson's young career.
+ I just sat there in awe the entire two hours and thirty minutes of the film, just completely stunned as to what I was seeing.
+ There Will Be Blood is ferocious, and it will be championed and attacked with an equal ferocity. When the dust settles, we may look back on it as some kind of obsessed classic.
+ With There Will Be Blood, Paul Thomas Anderson has taken a stab at making The Great American Movie -- and I daresay he’s made one of them.
+ This is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time
+ Daniel Day-Lewis and Paul Thomas Anderson have created one of the greatest movies of this time and perhaps of all time
- I hate the way the film forces us into its epic structure and purposefully fractured narrative as if the audience is a puppy having its little nose shoved in a puddle of its own making.
- i hated this movie. and years after watching it, i still hate it.
+ A masterpiece
+ Kubrick has made a movie that will have to be reckoned with on the highest level
+ One of the best scary movies ever made, one of the best scary movies even imaginable.
+ A horror classic. An unforgettable performance by Jack Nicholson as the tortured soul of Jack Torrance. 
+ My favorite film of Kubrick's. You feel like you're becoming as mad as Johnny while watching
+ A great movie with thrilling elements
+ Meticulously detailed and never less than fascinating, The Shining may be the first movie that ever made its audience jump with a title that simply says "Tuesday."
- Possibly the dumbest movie I've seen. Not scary at all. 
- One of Kubrick's most severely overcooked, overdetermined projects; Duvall fascinates, but the rest bores and wearies.
- I can't recall a more elaborately ineffective scare movie.
+ Saving Private Ryan is a masterpiece. It cements Steven Spielberg's reputation as one of the seminal filmmakers of the era.
+ An overwhelming experience.
+ Steven Spielberg's new film begins as a monumental epic; then it diminishes; and, by its finish, is baffling. 
+ I think this movie is just incredible, Mr Spielberg and Mr Hanks are just masters fo the film business.
+ A very high quality, which blends extreme action, with a underlying sadness for the disaster that was world war 2.
+ Saving Private Ryan is the best war movie ever made and one of the best in general in the movie history. 
+ No Hollywood film within recent memory has achieved such richness and originality of texture, such a compelling amalgam of passionate human drama and awesome technique.
- The result, I am sorry to say, is that Saving Private Ryan seems almost banal in its achievement, a film that sacrifices humanity for technical wizardry
- I found it tediously manipulative despite its Herculean energy.
- A bitter, bloody masterpiece with adrenalized emotions and hyper-realized images.	
+ Spotlight is simply a great story exceedingly well told, through characters whose fingers are perpetually stained with ink.
+ Best movie of the year, great performances all around, great story and script, great photography.
- A tedious bore. The cast chews up the scenery with twitchy acting trying to put energy into the plodding script.
- By modeling its structure so closely after All the President's Men, Spotlight only draws closer attention to its lack of scope and ambition.
- Spotlight while admirable, fell flat in nearly every department. It was painfully boring with no sense of direction. Not a very good follow up for Micheal Keaton. I expected more.
- Exposing the Catholic Church has never been so dull. One of the worst movies of the year.
+ McCarthy and his brilliant cast make hard work and truth-telling inspiring.
+ No need to bury the lede: Spotlight is a masterpiece.
+ A rigorously detailed telling of an important story that never loses sight of the human devastation. Terrific turns from the ensemble cast.
+ It's the best film McCarthy has ever made: restrained, intelligent and grown-up, but unfolding with the pacing and rhythm of a thriller.
+ ... a different and daring kind of cinematic experience, something rare enough in American popular cinema.
+ This is not only a great film, but an important landmark in how great films can be made.
+ We can quibble with small stuff in Boyhood. Supporting performances are variable, the sister drops out as a dramatic character ... I could go on. But the cumulative power is tremendous.
+ Intimate and insightful even in its weaker moments, Linklater finds strength and value in normality.
+ Once in a while a film comes along that not only makes you step back and look at the way movies are made, but forces you to reflect on how your own life is unfolding.
+ This bold movie may sound like a stunt, but it’s so much more than that. 
- One of the worst movies I have ever seen. Bad acting, terrible script, no plot, too long. Cheesy after-school special scenes with cliche, one-dimensional characters.
- Unbearably boring, I can't believe I wasted 3 hours of my life watching someone growing up as everyone else did, no story, no action, no drama, no nothing, it would have been a lot better if it was documentary movie with the character acting normal
+ As a film that dares to honor small moments and the life they add up to, Boyhood isn’t just a masterpiece. It’s a miracle.
+ In completing this simple, beautiful project Linklater took his time. And he rewards ours.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, Die Hard, Attack of the clones, Taxi Driver,Fight club,Dark Knight, Spectre, Le Meserables, Untouchables, Lives of others,Children of Heaven,Pan's Labrynth,Two towers,Disconnect,   
+ Might be the best of the series. It's certainly the most impressive visually, as Hogwarts, which sometimes felt as thrilling as a funeral home during Columbus' films, comes vividly alive in the third film.
+ A different kind of Harry Potter movie, a better kind... It's where this fantasy series has wanted to go all along.
+ In the end, Harry Potter and The Prisoner of Azkaban offers what neither of its predecessors, for all their wand-waving and witch-brooms, had: real magic.
- Prisoner of Azkaban lacks the depth that those of us old enough to drive may have enjoyed in the earlier Potter installments.
+ Potter 3 is, in its heart of hearts, a teenage angst movie...Cuaron has done a masterful job of bringing off this shift in the Potter paradigm without disrupting any disruption in the established style of the series and without any pandering concessions to the teen-movie genre.
+ A deeper, darker, visually arresting and more emotionally satisfying adaptation of the J.K. Rowling literary phenomenon, achieving the neat trick of remaining faithful to the spirit of the book while at the same time being true to its cinematic self.
+ The best of the Harry Potter films so far, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is also hands down the scariest, and the deepest.
+ Not only is this dazzler by far the best and most thrilling of the three Harry Potter movies to date, it's a film that can stand on its own even if you never heard of author J.K. Rowling and her young wizard hero.
+ With Cuaron leading the way, Harry has burst from the printed page to soar on-screen.
- This one just doesn't give me that feeling the first two gave me and it lacks the action of the 4th and 5th films. By far the worst so far.
- Meyer's teen bore-triangle has a mimetic quality, assuming the same degree of naval gazing self-interest as the target demographic.
- Certainly not awful, but the producer's dedication to Stephenie Meyer's drawn-out story creates a lumbering third movie that borderlines on downright dull.
- The net result is boredom unless you're already heavily invested in this series and bringing your own enthusiasm to the table.
- Poorly structured, poorly paced, poorly executed CGI in places and characters that are unlikeable, despite the fact that we should be rooting for them. An inaccessible mess.
- The Twilight Saga's New Moon is not terrible, despite featuring some excruciatingly lazy storytelling, atrocious performances, listless direction and a core storyline that is both uninteresting and somewhat disturbing.
- It’s intellectually and socially detrimental to both literature and cinema, simultaneously.
- New Moon, on the other hand, merely follows a dictated formula. It's a cheap, shoddy piece of work, one that banks on moviegoers' anticipation without even bothering to craft a satisfying experience for them. Its pandering is an insult.
+ Carried by Kristen Stewart's compellingly dark performance, but also by helmer Chris Weitz's robust visuals.
+ Once again, the three young leads give committed performances, with Lautner's character allowed a larger share of the spotlight this time around.
+ So long as there are people, there will be love stories -- I hope they all feel as lush and lively as this one.
- I would like to think that even if I was 14, either in body or spirit, I would still find this film an impossibly, incomprehensibly overlong and cacophonous bore.
- The only part of Fallen more boring than when things are exploding is when things aren't exploding.
- A cinematic avalanche in which Michael Bay eschews anything resembling plot or characters and instead screams at the audience's eyes for two and a half hours.
- This re-run of the previous thrills and spills displays a disappointing lack of ambition.
+ Built from the ground up to be a popcorn-devouring, eye-popping, nostalgia-sparking crowd-pleaser.
- One of the worst film going experiences I've ever had. It's loud, violent, offensive, crude and I had to put up with a screaming brat.
+ Filled with explosions, amazing special effects and a good dose of humor. It's everything a summer blockbuster should be.
+ Revenge of the Fallen is more proof [Bay] has a great eye for scale and a gift for visceral amazement.  
+ This is cinematic poetry for pinheads. It's less of a film than a reason for a noise ordinance. But for the faithful -- action aficionados and Transformers disciples -- it indisputably delivers.
- Clocking in at almost 2 1/2 hours, Revenge of the Fallen feels interminable.
+ The movie never feels like a nostalgia trip. It moves, breathes and sings with life.
+ As invigorating and funny now as it was on its original release half a century ago, A Hard Day's Night offers both a perfect showcase for the Beatles and an intriguing snapshot of fast-changing, early-1960s British society.
+ A Hard Day's Night is not particularly deep but it is fun - displaying an irreverent charm that is joyous. The Beatles come across as likable and witty.
+ As a Beatles fan this was perfect for me. It shows the boys at the beginning of their fame with some of their (in my opinion) best music. Loved it.
+ A Hard Day's Night is a chance to experience to the joyous, early days of pop - while at the same time noting how the pressures of re-energising national life were beginning to close in on the enchanting innocence of youth.
+ Of its time, sure, but eternally entertaining.
+ Comes bouncing at you from every angle, rubbery and untameable with the joys of teenagehood.
- Complete Rubbish!!! How can anyone possibly enjoy this film? There is no dancing or hamonizing? The Beatles will never be as great as NSync. This movies is for dorks, i.e. any one older than 16!
+ Refreshing, innovative and immensely funny
-  Alun Owen has provided a mainly plotless script, stuffed full of incident and the sort of joke-book-crossed-with-Goonery humour which the Beatles seem to have made their own.
- It's frenetic to the point of crazy while achieving a mark that barely exceeds mediocre.
- If you do go to see this thinly scripted and very repetitive action film, bring your seasickness pills [because of the heavy use of the "shakycam"].
- When it's not fast and furious, "The Bourne Ultimatum" settles for slick and noisy... and it's often hard to tell these two moods apart.
+ [Greengrass'] skillful use of handheld cameras and rapid fire editing help make this a truly visceral experience.
+ The Bourne Ultimatum is a fitting end to one of the finest blockbuster franchises of recent years.
+ As an action film, The Bourne Ultimatum is in a class of its own.
+ One of the best action flicks I've ever seen. From the moment the movie starts until it's jolting end, you are on the ride of your life. Damon, who I would have never imagined as an Action Star, has solidified his place among one of the greats.
+ It's a fantastic third installment (which is rarity in cinemas) Matt Damon is brilliant as Jason Bourne in this new edition to the Bourne saga. The Bourne Ultimatum fires on all cylinders with more thrills and more action sequences that is well directed, from Paul Greengrass, and well crafted.
+ The Bourne Ultimatum is a thrilling and riveting action movie, played out on a global backdrop and a liberal political tone.
+ two hours of powerful action and ultimate escapism.
+ Yes, it's as entertaining as you have heard. Maybe more so. Raiders of the Lost Ark is, in fact, about as entertaining as a commercial movie can be.
+ impossibly good.
+ Raiders of the Lost Ark is my favorite movie. I don't have to tell you why it's great. You know why it's great. Instead, what follows is a list of very personal moments.
+ As action adventure goes, it's about the best there is.
+ Steven Spielberg's rollicking adventure yarn still looks buoyant and dashing after 30 years.
+ The first and finest Indiana Jones adventure.
+ Indy's first adventure is a rip-roaring action masterpiece.
+ Justifiably one of the most indelible adventure films in cinematic history.
- at the end your mind is blank, yet you're parched, you're puffing hard -- you want relief.
- My big complaint: Take Indiana Jones out of the story, and nothing changes.
- A forgettable, tedious blockbuster.
- Tries hard to justify its presence, but with far too much angst and not enough to invest in, it fails.
- A badly scripted jumble of subplots whose jostling for screen time only serves to obscure the character who is supposed to be center stage.
- The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is as lost and confused as its lead character, and without the first film's characters played by Denis Leary and Martin Sheen, there's no conscience to the picture.
- Sparks fly. The air crackles. But the power soon drains -- and nothing quite works as it should.
+ Everyone has done an excellent job on director Marc Webb's exciting, well-crafted sequel to his first Spider-Man film.
+ It could easily be shorter and no one would be mad, but personally, I thought it was a tonal improvement on the last film and actually made me care that I was watching a movie about Spider-Man.
+ An adrenaline-pumping popcorn picture aimed at a youthful audience...
+ Garfield makes a terrific Spidey, and director Marc Webb guides him through the film's elephantine structure with energy and good humor.
+ Taken at face value as a basic summer action movie, it is enjoyable to watch.
- A very forgettable and easily missed comedy...
- A weak script makes for a wimpy movie.
- Gordon is miscast and the script is neither as funny nor as emotionally engaging as it should have been.
- [A] sappy and superficial adaptation...
+ A well-acted, family-friendly comedy...
+ It's nimble, bright and funny. It doesn't dumb down. It doesn't patronize. It knows something about human nature.
+ A mostly winning take on the tween-angst cartoon series.
+ Diary of a Wimpy Kid is a likable movie for kids that will make adults chuckle as well because of the movie's key ingredient -- wit.
+ It's also a heartfelt film, with nice messages about friendship and responsibility...
+ Perceptive, funny, unusually edgy voyage into the comic travails of schoolyard politics and childhood friendship.
+ the animation is stunning on the big screen and beautiful to watch.
+ Even the inescapable hype cannot diminish the fact that this is one great film.
+ Disney can take pride in this lion of a movie.
+ The Lion King, complete with jaunty songs by Elton John and Tim Rice, is undeniably and fully worthy of its glorious Disney heritage. It is a gorgeous triumph -- one lion in which the studio can take justified pride.
- The story line is a Joseph Campbell hero-quest so stripped down to its basics as to become dull.
+ Songs variable. Animation staggering. A winner.
- The Lion King is nevertheless host to many of the less savory qualities common to the studio's output.
+ Art History stands out as one of Joe Swanberg's most visually and conceptually accomplished experiments.
+ A classic story told through immersive visuals, great voice work and some of the most memorable songs in movie history. The Lion King defines animated classic.
- it suffers from a curiously undeveloped story line.
+ Great movie which keeps you in it until the very last second.
+ In the end (and it's a happy end, to be sure), Catch Me if You Can is as crisp and trim as a new suit.
+  Janusz Kaminski's gorgeous cinematography, Michael Kahn's graceful editing, Jeff Nathanson's clever script, and John Williams' score all work well in unison, but the film's masterstroke is the casting of Walken as DiCaprio's utterly decent father.
+ Everything about this swift and gorgeous and tremendously enjoyable film is played out in a rush of staccato edits, crisp performances, and charmingly giddy subplots that coalesce into Spielberg's most purely entertaining movie in years.
+ Brilliant performances by DiCaprio as Frank Jr. and Christopher Walken as his fallen father - and an enjoyable one by Tom Hanks.
+ DiCaprio could hardly be better. He brings this outrageous character and his demons to life with skill, sympathy and a symphony of small, telling touches.
+ Even in its somewhat unwieldy form, Catch Me If You Can is charming, sparkling entertainment.
- Forgettable as soon as you leave the theater. Too long, boring and dragged out. Not one of Speilberg's better works. DiCaprio and Hanks are just okay.
- Catch Me if You Can never takes itself or its subjects too seriously.
- Director Steven Spielberg keeps things hopping and hints that Frank's behavior was triggered by his parents' divorce, leaving his adored dad (Christopher Walken in a funny, grave, great performance) bereft. But what begins brightly gets bogged down over 140 minutes. A film that took off like a hare on speed ends like a winded tortoise.
+ Right there with the likes of "Up" and "Inside Out," "Zootopia" is so well done I forgot it was animated.
+ Bright-eyed and bushy-tailed as its long-eared lead while still brilliantly conscious of social issues, Zootopia represents Disney at its most visually resplendent and thematically ambitious.
+ Zootopia is a wonderful example of how Disney, at its best, can mix its past and present together in a very cool, compelling way.
+ Vividly mounted with a breadth of vision worth celebrating.
+ The brilliantly well-rounded Zootopia offers a thoughtful, inclusive message that's as rich and timely as its sumptuously state-of-the-art animation -- all while remaining fast and funny enough to keep younger viewers entertained.
+ There’s nothing wrong with a lesson or two when those lessons are packaged within such a great and memorable film.
+ Zootopia proves a successful amalgamation of disparate influences, much like its eponymous city. 
+  Zootopia ends up feeling like a genuine place. There's a vibrancy to it that runs through everything from the pace of the storytelling to the background details of the world in which the story takes place.
+ Smart, but better at delivering a message of tolerance than laughs.
+ It has the quality seal of all Disney films, but stands out because of the details.
- Unspeakably ghastly.
- I found this all profoundly disturbing.
- [It's] the sort of intellectually offensive children's movie one would make if one knew nothing about children.
- The sort of incoherent mess that invariably goes straight to video.
- One of the worst comedies ever.
- Falls short on nearly every level.
- has no redeeming qualities.
- The action sequences are phony-looking; the dialogue sounds largely improvised on the fly; the laughs are few and far between; and the acting ... is, to put it kindly, wooden.
- You're not actually still reading about this stupid, crass, condescending, dreadful movie, are you?
- The first Baby Geniuses, released in 1999, was one of the most inane, humorless, ill-conceived, poorly acted comedies of the year. As difficult as it is to imagine, the sequel is even worse.
+ This is one of the most beautiful films I have ever seen.
+ This epic film will still leave its mark on our collective memories, for it succeeds in affecting us.
- This is a film rife with mistakes that even a rookie director wouldn't make. How this ended up being made by Nolan blows my mind.
- Interstellar is a frustratingly flawed film that reaches for the stars but winds up lost in space.
- It's frustrating because there's so much to look at, so much money well spent in every frame, but "Interstellar" wears out its audience long before it ends.
- An unsatisfying blend of Gravity, 2001: A Space Odyssey, Solaris and The Collected Poems Of Dylan Thomas.
+ Interstellar is a grand gesture in every way. And yet, it's Nolan's most humane film to date.
+ Interstellar is a grand gesture in every way. And yet, it's Nolan's most humane film to date.
+ Interstellar's themes are universal and some of the dialogue really resonates too.
- Shows that long doesn't mean epic and serious doesn't mean deep.
- It quickly becomes a bore, full of feel-good nonsense and half-baked philosophies from Delpy and Hawke's self-important syllogisms.
- there isn't much magic.
- The incessant jawboning of Before Sunset is all foreplay and no climax.
+ Charming, talky romance for older teens and adults.
+ The best movie of the year so far.
+ The splendid sequel to an overlooked gem.
+ A jaw-droppingly beautiful and moving film, as defining a moment for its generation as its predecessor.
+ Richard Linklater's Before Sunrise gets a sweet, sad and touching sequel after almost a decade.
+ Really top notch work here.
+ A film that in its joy, optimism and aesthetic achievement keeps faith with American cinema at its finest.
+ A surprisingly charming film, which may be the first Christmas black comedy for children.  
+ This is engaging and frequently hilarious.But the joke is stretched a bit too far.
+ This is, perhaps, one of the most memorable child starring roles in movie history.
- Overrated. The burglar finale is great, but too much nonsense schmaltz.
- watching this all again today with a critical eye reveals that Home Alone's prat-fall humor has gotten completely worn out.
- Home Alone is frequently funny and led by a terrific starring turn from Macaulay Culkin, but an uneven script and a premise stretched unreasonably thin make it hard to wholeheartedly recommend.
+ A very good slapstick family film backed up with good performances from the adult cast. 
+ If you want some good old fashion family violence...look no further. This is brutal,man.  
+ Chris Columbus's junky,funny Home Alone is every kid's anarchical wish come true.
+ A hilarious comedy (although not a very believable one -- there can be no eight-year-olds this ingenious) that kids will love and adults won't mind sitting through either.
+ exquisite, light-drenched tone poem.
+ Is it beautifully animated? Yes. Is it one of the greatest anime movies of all time? Absolutely not. The animators do deserve applause for the gorgeous backdrops and attention to detail. The realistic portrayal of modern settings and aesthetics contributes to the down-to-Earth vibe that the film is going for. 
+ The best animated movie that I have ever seen. Breathtaking scenery over-all makes this film a must-watch. This movie is not only remarkably animated; it's also outstandingly written.
+ The feelings, thoughts, atmosphere, etc that was created in this animation made this awesome.
+ What you will definitely notice first is the animation. The drawings are beyond compare I have never seen such beautiful artwork in anime ever.
+ Animation & visual effects is stunning. Makoto Shinkai definitely gets a solid certificate to be one of the best visual directors out there at the moment. 
+  This movie is all about real life.. Yes, it may be sad. Yes, there might be no happy ending like in those Disney fairy tales. But there will be something much better - a real life love story that will blow you away..
+ I am moved to somewhere beyond words. Echoes of my own life aside there is something about the emotion that moves you-why am I crying? I don't know.
- Honest to god, I think they should've done up the storyline again because it was so badly done and of course gave the frigging thing episodes, it's meant to be a film! They have completely messed this whole thing up!
+ The development of this film is a well achieved flow through all its three segments; a simple but universal story that all can relate to "love and relationships".
+ Fast, funny and smarter than its dunce-cap demeanor lets on.
+ The supporting characters add depth to the comedic pairing of Tatum and Hill.
+ 21 Jump Street is a smartly stupid buddy comedy that plays with the ridiculousness of its set-up.
+ Chaotic and far-fetched yet funny enough to have audiences rolling in the aisles.
+ Remake or no, this movie is hysterical.
- Mediocre jokes built around recycled ideas.
- Strained and crass comedy.
- It's a good thing 21 Jump Street is funny, because in terms of pure filmmaking, it is a near-embarrassment.
+ Against all odds, 21 Jump Street is an immensely enjoyable, frequently hilarious film.
+ Perfect blend of action and comedy that doubles as a satire of teen culture and TV to film adaptations. Hill and Tatum are superb leads. Hilarious and fun.
+ Enchanting and impressively crafted.
+ Vivid, amusing and genuinely awe-inspiring.
+ This one is an event, a huge accomplishment in the world of traditional animation and a powerful rebuttal to the notion that films for children must be simplistic and visually dull.
+ Artful but not arty, Spirited Away is a handcrafted cartoon, as personal as an Utamaro painting, yet its breadth and heart give it an appeal that should touch American viewers of all ages.
+ It's an amazing work, filled with a visual intelligence that's meticulously composed and obscenely clever.
+ A stirring and memorable adventure of poetry, color, tones and narrative all in the vividness of animation.
+ A stirring and memorable adventure of poetry, color, tones and narrative all in the vividness of animation.
- Yes, Spirited Away is a triumph of imagination, but it's also a failure of storytelling.
+ The impressive watercolour backgrounds and intense focus on the smallest details make Spirited Away more than a kid's flick. It will grab hold and impress, amaze and entertain before letting you go.
+ What it does have is the same kind of free-floating, imaginative animation, taking wing for even wilder flights of fantasy.
- Dumb and loud, with questionable material.
- It's your usual low-budget, unbelievably bad sequel.
- Joyless tedium. The special effects are ubiquitous but not very special.
+ A bright, fast, kiddie-oriented lark.
- You know how awful this movie looks in the previews? Well, that's exactly how bad the movie actually is.
- Adults may be disappointed, but ten-year-olds should love it.
- A truly numbing experience.
- Unnecessary but not entirely unpleasant.
- It might be early, but this will definitely take the award for worst film of 2005.
- Color, movement and loud noises do not disguise an idiotic movie.
+ Wild West-themed final installment is fine for older tweens.
+ Affectionate, innovative, and vaguely lunatic.
+ Every bit as confident and slick as its two predecessors.
+ It satisfyingly ties up the various plot strands that were flapping in the breeze from the last installment.
- Ties up all the loose ends but runs out of energy and inspiration.
- Makes a few bows in the direction of time-travel complexities, and then settles down to be a routine Western comedy.
- This last film in the Back to the Future trilogy is the most unrealistic of the three.
+ A good conclution for the famous trilogy, fun but not as good as the other two entries. 
+ A fitting end to one of the most enjoyable fantasy series of the 1980s.
+ Solid end to super fun trilogy; Fox & Lloyd still great.
- The Happening is his first hilariously awful film.
- Horror film is long on peril, but thin on plot.
- While not as laughable as the narcissistic Lady in the Water ,it fails just as miserably as narrative and even more miserably with its flat characters and tone deaf dialogue.
- The plot is absurdly preachy and illogical, and the dialogue uneven, with stinging lines followed by stinkers.
- Woeful clunker of a paranoid thriller.
- There are some creepy moments but overall The Happening is a bit of a non-event.
- The movie is a bummer, from beginning to end.
- Another case of elegant filmmaking kneecapped by a thunderingly stupid concept.
- Other than its ripe possibility for mockery, I cannot think of anything that makes the film really worthwhile.
- The true disaster on display in The Happening is Shyamalan's career hitting rock bottom.
+ It's a powerful film and a terrific showcase for the versatility of star Robert De Niro.
+ This is a wholly remarkable film, flaws and all. In fact, even the flaws are significant.
+ Taxi Driver is a brilliant study of alienation, obsession, paranoia and perverse desire. There's an undeniable power and grittiness that very few films have come close to capturing since.
+ Melodramatic as it often is, the film is a riveting watch and De Niro provides a character study it is impossible to forget.
+ Powerful drama and portrait of insanity.
+ Scorcese's first masterpiece.
+ Director Martin Scorsese's nightmare vision of Manhattan is important, impulsive work.
+ Taxi Driver is one of the best films ever made. Movies don't get any better than this.
+ A masterful psychological study, the depth of which can only fully be appreciated on repeat viewings.
+ Taxi Driver is grounded in its socio-political context, yet it also touches on something more universal... how one finds purpose and identity in a collapsing capitalistic society.
+ Hanks is excellent and I applaud Spielberg for delving into some new territory.
- What's shocking here is the inanity of it all.
+ Lovely and well worth sharing with your family.
+ A crowd-pleasing and entertaining film about humanity and heart with excellent performances and competent directing from Spielberg.
+ A feel-good comedy that is very different. I highly recommend watching it!
- A handful of scenes are effective in isolation, but 'The Terminal' doesn't hold together overall.
- Discordant, unsatisfying, sometimes emotionally incoherent.
+ Showcases a fine performance from Hanks but one that gets lost while attempting to transcend a higher purpose.
+ The Terminal is a surefooted fable about what connects us as humans.
+ A rather enjoyable piece of complete and utter fluff.
